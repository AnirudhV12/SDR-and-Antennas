# SDR-and-Antennas
Exploring the build and use of different types of antennas to analyse their signals on an RTL-SDR V4 (Software-Defined Radio). 

## Introduction
As an Electronics and Communications Engineering student, I wanted to gain hands-on experience with various communication techniques. This led me to explore Software Defined Radios (SDRs) and their practical applications, including antenna design.

A radio is any kind of device that wirelessly transmits or receives signals in the radio frequency
(RF) part of the electromagnetic spectrum to facilitate the transfer of information. In today's
world, radios exist in a multitude of items such as cell phones, computers, car door openers,
vehicles, and televisions.

Traditional hardware based radio devices limit cross-functionality and can only be modified
through physical intervention. This results in higher production costs and minimal flexibility in
supporting multiple waveform standards.

A software-defined radio (SDR) is a radio in which some or all of the physical layer functions are software defined. It can be used to analyse signals of different analog modulation techniques, such as AM, FM, PM and even digital modulated waves such as ASK, FSK, PSK, QPSK, BFSK, etc.,
